# React Boilerplate 2

Asdougl's second edition of React Boilerplate, this time including a wide array of pre-integrated tools

- **redux toolkit** for state management
- **react router 6** for better routing
- **custom service api** for easy rest API integrations
- **vite** for faster build times

Directories now contain `_.md` files to help organise what each directory should contain, delete these files if you get the gist
