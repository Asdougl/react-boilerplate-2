# React Boilerplate 2

Asdougl's second edition of React Boilerplate, this time built on [vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

Built in tools:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for fast style development
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) for state management
- [React Router 6](https://reactrouter.com) for better routing
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com) for http requests (fetch also available)
- [DayJS](https://day.js.org) for date management (Hurry up Temporal API)

Also includes a fairly versatile [custom services api](src/services/api/about.md) that can be edited to meet the requirements of a project

Directories now contain `_.md` files to help organise what each directory should contain, delete these files if you get the gist

Serves on port 8080 by default

## Scripts

`npm run dev` to run a development server  
`npm run build` to build static files  
`npm run test` to run jest test scripts
